# geneticOpt
The main idea of this project is to develop a Python module for totally customizable genetic algorithms. This library will allow since basic to advanced users create their own genetic models in a easy way. Focusing on computational performance, this module will be developed entirely in C language.

## The module in its first version
This module will be composed by the following components:

### Objective Function
It will be an user defined component. The user defines a Python function that evaluates an individual of the population.

### Representation
This module will support the basic representation methods:
- Binary.
- Integer.
- Real.

### Population Initialization
Initially, this module will suport only random and heuristic initialization methods. The heuristic initialization will be an user defined Python function, like the objective function.

### Selection Strategy
Some classical selection methods:
- Roulett Wheel Selection.
- Tournament Selection.
- Rank-Based Selection.

### Reproduction Strategy
The usual reproduction strategies in genetic algorithms are:
- Crossover.
- Mutation.

These methods are very important and can be developed in many ways. Some classical approachs are:
- n-point Crossover.
- Aritmethic Crossover.
- Uniform Random Mutation.

### Replacement Strategy
Initially, this module suports only the elitist replacement strategy (only the best individuals from the initial population and its offsprings survives to the next generation.)

## Some ideas for future releases
- Develop some tools for statistical analysis of the genetic model defined by the user. The objective of these tools is to allow the user to modify his genetic model according to his optimization problem and tune the genetic parameters.
